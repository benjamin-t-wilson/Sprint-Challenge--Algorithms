'''
Your function should take in a single parameter (a string `word`)
Your function should return a count of how many occurences of ***"th"*** occur within `word`. Case matters.
Your function must utilize recursion. It cannot contain any loops.
'''
# use this to keep track of how many times we've run
# since if I put it inside, it will reset each time.
# normally I would add another parameter to the function to keep track
# but if I interpret this right, I am not allowed to do that

        total = count
        count = 0
        return total

        # return recursively the word split around the index of "th"
        # I had to leave 0's behind, because of a unique test case
        # where after removing a "th", it allowed another "th" to be created
        # causing the function to run more than what was initially present
